# ProteinGGT: Generalized Graph Transformer Enhances Protein Function Annotation under Out-of-distribution Contexts

## Overview
Here, we introduce ProteinGGT, a generalized graph transformer based method designed for protein function prediction in out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, we then fine-tune ProteinGGT for two downstream tasks, drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction and subcellular localization, yielding higher predictive accuracy than other state-of-the-art baselines on OOD test sets and providing interpretable insights into the prediction results.
